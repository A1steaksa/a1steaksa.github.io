		<h1>Rules</h1>

		<p>
			These rules are basic guidelines and are subject to change.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				General Rules
					<ul>
						<li>
							RDM - No one likes dying without reason.  If you're going to kill someone, you should have some kind of reasonable explanation.  I.e. He stole from you, he threatened you, etc.
						</li>
						<li>
							RDA - Don't arrest people without reason.  This should be pretty self explanatory.
						</li>
						<li>
							Prop abuse - Props should be used to make your bases better, or to decorate.  Don't use props to fly or clip through walls or kill people or to do anything that breaks the game.
						</li>
					</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Raiding/Criminality Rules
					<ul>
						<li>
							All jobs that are not intended to directly affect other players may partake in raiding and criminal behavior, as a general rule.
						</li>
						<li>
							These jobs cannot be criminals: 
							<ul>
								<li>
									Police
								</li>
								<li>
									Mayor
								</li>
								<li>
									Gun Dealers
								</li>
							</ul>

						</li>
					</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Job specific rules
				<ul>
					<li>
						Gun dealers
						<ul>
							<li>
								You must sell publicly - Because the gun dealer job exists to affect other players, you must sell to all people and cannot only sell to a single group.
							</li>
							<li>
								You are highly encouraged to have a store, but you are able to be a wandering salesman so long as you respond to requests.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Police
						<ul>
							<li>
								You must enforce the default laws and, to the extent possible within the server rules, the mayor's laws.
							</li>
							<li>
								So long as you are doing that, you are allowed to be corrupt.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
